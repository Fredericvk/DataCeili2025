# DataCeili2025 - Hands on with Fabric: end to end data engineering
Are you wanting to learn how to use Microsoft Fabric for data engineering, data warehousing or other data projects? Then this is the session for you!
This repo contains all the information and content you need to successfully complete the DataCeili training day.


## In this hands-on workshop we will:
- Ingest data from a range of sources using Data Factory and Fabric Mirroring
- Transform data with Spark and Data Warehouse
- Orchestrate with complex and parallel pipelines
- Explore different options for querying and consumption
- Ingest and transform streaming data
- Demonstrate ways to integrate OneLake with Fabric engines, and external engines
- Work through options to monitor your solution, including how you can make your Fabric components more resilient and gain visibility into Fabric capacities.
- Deploy Fabric environments with command line interfaces which enable automation.

Attendees are expected to bring laptops. Sandbox environments will be provided. At least basic knowledge of Fabric and/or Data Engineering / Data Warehousing is helpful. This session is intermediate but will be guided.

# Agenda:
> [!TIP]
> You can progress through these exercises at your own pace. While we have structured logical breaks within the session, these are merely suggestions. You are not required to stop if you prefer to continue working. These breaks are provided to accommodate those who may need them. Feel free to continue through the material as fits your learning style and needs.
